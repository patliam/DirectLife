# DirectLife
I created a console app when I started but it does nothing, everything is run from tests using the VS Test Explorer pane. It would have been better as a dll.

In the ~Tests project the Integration tests matches the tests specified and alluded to in the test instructions.
The folders in the ~Tests project contain the busniess logic unit tests

In the DirectLife project itself:
- the BusinessLogic folder contains the functional objects
- the Data folder contains the model
- the Interfaces folder contains the interfaces
