# DirectLife
Interview Test
I created a console app when I started but it does nothing, everything is run from tests using the VS Test Explorer pane. Would have been better as a dll.

Integration tests matches the tests specified and alluded to in the test instructions.
The folders in the tests project contain the busniess logic unit tests

In the DirectLife project itself:
  the BusinessLogic folder contains the functional objects
  the Data folder contains the model
  the Interfaces folder contains the interfaces
